# Prompt 051 — Equipment Compliance Holds and Impact Assessment

## Scope
Add automated overdue hard stops, controlled impact assessment, and quality-event integration to Equipment Management.

## Compliance hold model
Active equipment with overdue required calibration or preventive maintenance receives a system-created `EquipmentComplianceHold`. The hold is separate from administrative equipment status so the system does not attribute a scheduler action to a human or silently rewrite regulated status.

An uncleared compliance hold means the equipment is operationally not usable. Holds are deduplicated by tenant, equipment, control kind, and overdue due date.

## Clearance
A hold can be cleared only by an authorized equipment manager and only after the corresponding equipment next-due date has advanced beyond the held due date. A controlled clearance reason and actor are recorded and audited.

## Impact assessment
Impact assessments are append-only and capture disposition, affected scope, rationale, assessor, time, optional linked compliance hold, and optional linked quality event.

`NO_IMPACT` does not create a quality event. `POTENTIAL_IMPACT` and `CONFIRMED_IMPACT` create or reuse a deduplicated system quality event of type `EQUIPMENT_FAILURE` through the existing governed quality-event system-intake service.

## Boundary
Notifications, equipment workspace usability indicators, analytics, service/repair impact workflows, recall/quarantine workflows, and Prompt 051 completeness review remain subsequent slices.
