# Prompt 050 — Controlled Final Closure and Electronic Signature

## Slice 5 scope
This slice adds the governed final closure boundary for quality events.

It adds:
- final closure only from `VERIFICATION`;
- required investigation evidence;
- required CAPA presence and completion;
- a passing effectiveness check for every CAPA action;
- explicit closure reason and signature-meaning confirmation;
- password reauthentication with failed-attempt throttling;
- immutable `ElectronicSignature` evidence bound to the quality event;
- append-only `QualityEventClosure` evidence;
- transactional event status/history/audit updates.

## Closure gates
A quality event cannot close unless all of the following are true at commit time:
1. the event remains in `VERIFICATION`;
2. at least one investigation/root-cause/risk record exists;
3. at least one CAPA action exists;
4. no CAPA action remains open;
5. every CAPA action has at least one PASS effectiveness check;
6. the signer has `quality_event.manage`, is ACTIVE, has an enabled credential, confirms the signature meaning, and successfully reauthenticates.

## Signature controls
The closure signature reuses the established electronic-signature control pattern:
- `REAUTHENTICATION` authentication event with purpose `QUALITY_EVENT_CLOSURE`;
- five failed attempts in 15 minutes triggers throttling;
- successful authentication receives a five-minute validity window;
- signature payload is SHA-256 bound to tenant, event, event number, signer, closure reason, and signed timestamp;
- signature meaning is `CLOSED` with controlled meaning text.

## Integrity
Closure evidence, signature evidence, successful authentication, `VERIFICATION -> CLOSED` lifecycle history, and audit evidence are committed in one database transaction. Closed events remain immutable under the existing lifecycle controls.

## Migration
`0032_quality_event_controlled_closure`

## Boundary
Escalation/notifications, cross-event trending, automated quality-event triggers, and operational reporting remain subsequent Prompt 050 slices.
