# Prompt 050 — Investigation, Root Cause, and Risk Assessment

## Slice 3 scope
This slice adds append-only investigation evidence to governed quality events.

It adds:
- investigation findings and affected-scope assessment;
- optional evidence summary;
- governed root-cause method (`FIVE_WHYS`, `FISHBONE`, `FAULT_TREE`, `OTHER`);
- documented root cause;
- 1–5 likelihood and 1–5 impact scoring with persisted risk score;
- append-only sequence history per quality event;
- authenticated list/create API under existing `quality_event.read` / `quality_event.manage` permissions;
- transactional `QUALITY_EVENT_INVESTIGATION_RECORDED` audit evidence;
- focused authorization and validation tests.

## Workflow boundary
Investigation evidence may be recorded only while an event is `INVESTIGATING`, `ACTION_REQUIRED`, or `VERIFICATION`. Recording evidence does not silently advance event status.

## Integrity boundaries
- investigation records are append-only;
- risk score must equal likelihood × impact and both dimensions are constrained to 1–5;
- event references and investigator identity remain tenant-bound by composite foreign keys;
- event closure remains governed by a later controlled closure/e-signature slice;
- CAPA actions and effectiveness checks are not created implicitly by an investigation record.
