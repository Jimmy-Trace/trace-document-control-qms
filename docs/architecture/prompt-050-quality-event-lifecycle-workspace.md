# Prompt 050 — Quality Event Lifecycle Workspace

## Slice 2 scope
This slice adds operational quality-event lifecycle controls on top of the Prompt 050 foundation.

It adds:
- quality-event workspace visibility under `quality_event.read`;
- separately gated mutation controls under `quality_event.manage`;
- reason-required lifecycle actions;
- governed forward progression `OPEN -> INVESTIGATING -> ACTION_REQUIRED -> VERIFICATION`;
- owner and due-date updates with same-tenant ACTIVE-owner validation;
- derived overdue visibility without implicit status mutation;
- append-only `QualityEventChange` history for status, owner, and due-date changes;
- transactional `QUALITY_EVENT_LIFECYCLE_UPDATED` audit evidence;
- row locking during lifecycle mutation to prevent stale concurrent transitions.

## Controlled closure boundary
`CLOSED` remains unavailable in this slice. Closure will be introduced only with the later controlled closure workflow after investigation, root-cause/risk, CAPA/effectiveness, approvals, and electronic-signature requirements are implemented.

## Integrity boundaries
- closed events are immutable;
- no destructive change-history edits are introduced;
- lifecycle mutation requires `quality_event.manage` and a nonblank reason;
- owner changes accept only ACTIVE users from the same tenant;
- overdue state is derived from due date and never silently changes regulated event status.
